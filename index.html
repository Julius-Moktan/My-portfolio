<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Julius Moktan from Darjeeling, West Bengal, India.
I’m someone who thrives on creativity, innovation, and the joy of building something meaningful from scratch. Coding and web design aren’t just hobbies for me — they’re powerful tools that let me express who I am and how I see the world. Every line of code I write is a step toward creating something unique, authentic, and personal.

Even though I’m at the beginning of my journey as a web developer, I approach each project with curiosity, dedication, and a strong desire to learn. I love experimenting with layouts, colors, and user experiences, trying to bring fresh ideas to life on the web. This website is my very first project, and it's more than just a page — it’s a reflection of my passion, effort, and vision.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work. I hope you enjoy what I’ve created, and I look forward to growing and sharing even more in the future!</P>

<h2>My Journey</h2>
<p>Over the years, I’ve explored different industries, picked up diverse skills, and grown through every experience.</P><br>
<h3>Code Comma Technology – Telemarketing Agent</h3>
<p>My first step into the professional world began as a telemarketing agent for a U.S.-based IT company. It taught me how to communicate clearly, think on my feet, and connect with people from different backgrounds.</p><br>
<h3>Moto World Nepal – Sales Executive</h3>
<p>Driven by curiosity and a love for bikes, I joined Moto World Nepal — one of the top helmet and moto accessories shops in the country. As a sales executive, I learned not just how to sell, but how to understand customers and build trust with them.</p><br>
<h3>Centrix Contact System – Telemarketing Agent</h3>
<p>Once again, I found myself in the world of U.S. outbound calling — this time with a company providing I.O.S services. This role sharpened my persuasion and problem-solving skills even further.</p><br>
<h3> John’s Cafe and Restro – Co-owner</h3>
<p>One of my proudest chapters was co-owning and working in a café. From crafting menus to managing daily operations, this experience helped me lead, serve, and build something from the ground up — a feeling that now fuels my passion for creating on the web.</p><br>
<p>Each of these roles added a new layer to who I am — a communicator, a creator, and someone always excited to learn and build. Now, I’m channeling that same energy into web design and development — a new chapter I’m thrilled to begin.</p>
